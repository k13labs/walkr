# _About_

Walkr (walk-reduce) is a Clojure library built to help you easily walk-reduce clojure data structures.

# _Usage_

Here's a simple example.

```clj
(ns user
  (:require [walkr.core :as w]
            [clojure.string :as str]))

(w/prewalk-reduce
  (fn [acc item]
    (if (string? item)
      [(conj acc (str/lower-case item)) (str/upper-case item)]
      [acc item]))
  #{}
  [{:foo {:bar {:value #{"cOlD"}}
                      :other "hOt"}}
   {:foo {:bar {:value "ColDer"}
          :other "hoTteR"}}])
;;; =>
;;; [#{"cold" "hot" "colder" "hotter"}
;;;  [{:foo {:bar {:value #{"COLD"}}
;;;          :other "HOT"}}
;;;   {:foo {:bar {:value "COLDER"}
;;;          :other "HOTTER"}}]]
```

See the existing tests for more examples.
